<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Tushar Saini, a passionate and driven B.Tech student with a focus on Machine Learning, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
  With a solid foundation in C++ and Python, I love diving deep into coding challenges and developing innovative solutions. Currently,
  I'm expanding my skills in web development, eager to build full-stack applications that make a difference.</p>

<p>I'm also working towards mastering Machine Learning, from Linear Regression to advanced algorithms like Support Vector Machines
  and Decision Trees. My goal is to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios, whether it's through Kaggle competitions,
  hackathons, or impactful projects.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me perfecting my swimming form or exploring new ways to stay fit and focused.
  I'm always up for a challenge and constantly looking for opportunities to grow, whether it's through internships, research,
  or collaboration on exciting projects.</p>
